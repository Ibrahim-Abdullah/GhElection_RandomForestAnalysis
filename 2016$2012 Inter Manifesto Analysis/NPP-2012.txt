Transforming Lives, Transforming Ghana
Building a free, fair and prosperous society A PROGRAMME OF TRANSFORMATION
NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY (NPP) MANIFESTO FOR ELECTION 2012

Foreword
This year's election is a historic moment for Ghana. Ghanaians have a simple choice to make in either moving forward with the NPP or staying with the failed policies and personalities of the NDC administration that have brought them hardships and poverty. We, in the NPP have been in the forefront of Ghana's development and transformation agenda. Our record of achievement during our time in government points to the fact that we know how to bring prosperity to Ghana and also make our motto of development in freedom a reality for all. Our education policy is the key to both individual and national development, and will be a priority of my Presidency. I pledge

to extend free education to the Senior High School level, build public Universities in regions without one and raise the quality of education at all levels with more and better facilities, teaching and equipment. Our education system will equip our people for the jobs of the future.
Working in partnership with the private sector, we will make DV\VWHPDWLFHIIRUWWRODXQFKDQLQGXVWULDOUHYROXWLRQDQGQG new markets for Ghanaian products and services. We will give new impetus to value-addition. These will deliver the jobs that the teeming youth of the country are yearning for.

We live in desperate and trying times, with hope replaced by despair, and promise by helplessness, desolation and hardships. Over the past three years, Ghana has retrogressed under an administration that lacks purpose. Leadership is weak, the economy backsliding, the cost of living rising at an unbearable rate, the standard of education falling, healthcare collapsing and unprecedented corruption being the order of the day.

What Ghanaians have witnessed, under the late President John E A Mills and Vice President John D. Mahama is a failed leadership that has failed Ghana and has failed you. What we have witnessed under the four years of the MillsMahama administration is an unprecedented period of squandered opportunities under a weak, corrupt and incompetent leadership.
My message is simple: it has been four wasted years and Ghanaians deserve much better than this. But, on December 7, the people will once again have the power to rescue Ghana and entrust the responsibility of moving Ghana and Ghanaians forward together into the hands of those they can trust to deliver: the NPP.
Our manifesto contains the vision that our party, under the purposeful and competent leadership of Nana Akufo-Addo, has prepared itself to deliver as your government.

Our Transformation Programme
Our message is simple: change is due.
We will not achieve our aspirations and our hopes by doing things the same way. After 55 years of independence, with all our God given resources, the Ghanaian is still confronted with widespread poverty and wallowing in an unacceptably low quality of life. We are offering a transformation programme that will put our dear country on the path of peace, opportunity, and prosperity for generations to come. By transforming the economy, promoting good governance, respect for the rule of law and proudly serving you, the people of Ghana, ZHZLOOVLJQLFDQWO\WUDQVIRUPDQGLPSURYHWKHTXDOLW\RIRXU lives. We need to transform our dear country to move Ghana forward. We need to transform Ghana into a good society that gives to the Ghanaian, a good life.
 1(:3$75,27,&3$57<0$1,)(672

Many of our people go about their lives everyday with just too many challenges to enable them live a comfortable life. Our infrastructure is weak and incapable of supporting the proper functioning of the country. Our lives are saddled with unreliable power and energy supply, frequent water shortages and XELTXLWRXV WUDIF LQ WKH FLWLHV DQG SRRU URDGV DQG WUDQVSRUW networks nationwide. Access to quality education and quality healthcare is limited to only those who can afford it. Ghana has EHHQGHFODUHGDVWKHQGORZHVWJOREDOO\LQVDQLWDWLRQDFFHVV We have one of the lowest savings rates and the highest bank interest rates one of the lowest in productivity. Our societies and social structures are breaking down, threatening security, safety and peace of our country. The structure of our economy, despite 55 years of independence, is fundamentally still the same, limiting development. Fifty years after independence, we are still a third world country despite having achieved middle-income status. We work too hard for too little because we haven't changed the way we do things since we achieved nationhood.
The world is rapidly changing and we are being left behind. It is clear that development does not happen by accident. Development occurs through well-conceived and executed plans and policies that focus on the ever changing and increasing needs of people. It is about a dynamic response to the needs of the people, and about communities, cities and countries that work. The way things are going on in our country, development has become a wish, instead of a clear vision. We cannot make that clear vision realisable unless we change the way we do things. It is that change that we so desperately need to move our country forward and bring hope and opportunity to RXUSHRSOHDQGWKDWGHQHVRXUWUDQVIRUPDWLRQDJHQGD

It comprises transforming our econRP\ IURP LWV SUHLQGHSHQGHQFH VWUXFWXUH WR D PRGHUQ VW century economy, one driven by knowledge, value addition and industrialisation that will create jobs.

We will transform our healthcare to ensure a healthy population and an increased life expectancy. We will transform governance such that it facilities the right attitudes and relationship between government, the administration and you the people. Our objective is to transform Ghana into a modern nation with an attractive quality of life and an economy that is business and development focused. This change requires strong vision and strong leadership.
 1(:3$75,27,&3$57<0$1,)(672

Our vision is a free and fair Ghana that offers opportunities for our people, a vision every Ghanaian relates to. This vision is based on providing an environment within which Ghanaians can achieve their aspirations.
The NPP has a proud history of providing value and comfort to the Ghanaian people. Legislation and policies introduced under the Kufuor administration include providing free Compulsory Basic Education, the National Health Insurance Scheme, )UHH0DWHUQDO&DUH)UHH+HDOWK&DUHIRUXQGHU\HDUROGV the Metro Mass Transport, Micro and Small Loans Centre and the Livelihood Empowerment and Advancement Programme (LEAP). We promoted good governance and democracy by strengthening our institutions of governance. Today, many of these gains have been rolled back and the country has been set back. We aim to reverse the retrogression and put the country back on track; set it on a new course for a transformed and prosperous Ghana. This requires an overhaul of the way we do things through a radical transformation and replacement of many of existing policies with innovative and solutions-oriented ones.
We have in the NPP the team of talented men and women who can provide the leadership to implement this programme of transformation
Ghana can and must change. We have this as our clear vision and will make it happen by providing the leadership, right policies and effective management and the inspiration. We invite every Ghanaian to join us make this happen by voting for Nana $NXIR$GGRDQGWKH133LQWKH'HFHPEHUHOHFWLRQV

In this changing, competitive global environment, good leadership, good governance and good policies hold the answer to the success of a nation. Weak, ineffective and visionless leadership is a sure way to become a failed state.
Our nation's potential for greatness is immense. This potential can only be harnessed and achieved with the right leadership. The NPP sees the task ahead as two-fold: transformational leadership and, competent management of national affairs. By tackling our leadership and management weaknesses, we will unleash the talents of the Ghanaian people and build a great nation.
Our leader and presidential candidate, Nana Akufo-Addo, is competent, committed, experienced, honest, and has a clear vision to lead the transformation of Ghana. Over the past three decades, he has been energising Ghanaians to overcome obstacles to democracy and freedom. He has committed his life to the cause of enhancing the life and dignity of the ordinary Ghanaians. Nana Akufo-Addo is determined to identify the best people and develop new talents from all walks of life to move Ghana forward.
 1(:3$75,27,&3$57<0$1,)(672

BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS OF A FREE AND FAIR SOCIETY
The agenda of transforming Ghana requires a presidency that will act as the force in driving the public sector and energising the private sector; a presidency that will provide the vision, direction and inspiration for us, Ghanaians, to excel. What the NPP is offering is a leadership that will deliver. We will govern with decisive action plans and timetables, and allocate resources prudently. We will develop and implement policies, monitor the results and be prepared to take corrective action to keep the agenda on track. We will lead this country from hopelessness to prosperity.

It is said, "the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers". Our teachers are paramount in our efforts to provide quality education for our children. As a result, our Teachers First policy will focus on raising the support and quality of our teachers through monitored and evaluated training, professional development, and improved incentives. Additionally, there is a need to attract, train and retain more young professionals into the teaching profession, especially in the rural areas. Accordingly, we will facilitate teacher training nationwide, as well as special incentives especially for those who teach in rural areas.
Our objective is to transform our teachers to enable them to lead the transformation of the quality of our students. We expect that enhanced teacher training, monitoring and evaluation will result in better performance in school and students results. Additionally, we will ensure that there is performance evaluation right to the level of Directors in the education industry to enable us achieve value in their outcomes

Accordingly, we will, i) promulgate the National Housing Policy, which will provide the overall policy framework for the industry, ii) establish a Housing Agency dedicated to facilitating the role of the private sector players (e.g. GREDA) in delivering both social housing and low and mid-income housing schemes across the country iii) encourage the private sector to partner with Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to build affordable rental units across the country.

In our view, a major impediment to our country's economic growth and development is our weakness in planning and consistently implementing our development programmes. Additionally, most of our development projects and programmes are not an integrated and coordinated framework and, therefore, our infrastructure in many aspects is fragmented. Poor, fragmented or no planning in our cities and towns has consequently resulted in arbitrariness in our development efforts, resulting in poor distribution of resources, poor social structure, huge economic and business costs and a consequent low quality of life.
We will strengthen and resource the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) and use it as an organ for planning our economic transformation.
We will harmonize and regulate all laws on land use planning, provide for sustainable development of land and human settlements through a decentralized planning system, ensure judicious use of land in order to improve quality of life, promote health, safety and regulate national, regional, district and local spatial planning, and generally deal with spatial aspects of socio-economic development.
We will restructure and enhance the capacity of existing planning agencies in order effectively to prepare and provide for spatial, land use and human settlement planning components of the national development system as may be required by government and the NDPC.

International organisations provide opportunities for the world community to come together to discuss and take decisions on global challenges that require coordinated action at the international level. It is on such occasions that smaller countries, like Ghana, contribute on an equal footing to the setting of the rules of international security and the global economic order. We will welcome such opportunities at the international level to demonstrate in its diplomacy that a smaller country like Ghana can defend its national interests, maintain its sovereign independence, and yet take decisions with its more powerful friends, partners and allies without deferring to them.

The granting of dual citizenship has now restored the basic rights of Ghanaians living abroad, who for one reason or another, had to adopt the citizenship of their host countries, and thereby lost their Ghanaian citizenship. Ghanaians living abroad are a critical part of the skills base that is needed for economic transformation. Rather than treating diaspora Ghanaians as second-class citizens, the NPP would put in place a policy framework that would encourage the Ghanaians in the diaspora who may or may not have acquired other citizenships to bring their skills (and those of their children) back home to assist in the development of our country.

Moving Ghana Forward Together
This document has laid out our vision for the future transformed Ghana.
We believe that we need change now to move our country forward together. We owe it to our children and grandchildren not to throw their future away, but be strong and develop a country of which we can all be proud..
On 7 December you will have a choice.
A choice of four more years of poor policies and failed leadership, which have failed Ghana and failed you. Four more years of corruption, lies, deceit and propaganda. Four more years of broken promises.
Or a choice for the chance to move Ghana decisively forward. A choice for leadership and the vision to make this country great. A choice for building a society of peace, opportunity and prosperity.

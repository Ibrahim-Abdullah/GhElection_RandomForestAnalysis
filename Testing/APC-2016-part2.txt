CHAPTER 1.
EDUCATION
Societies that have made rapid progress around the world have all put education at the heart of their development. To be able to transform Ghana, therefore, it is important that our children and young people are equipped with the kind of education that places them at par with their peers across the globe. Ghana's children should have the education that ensures that they achieve their full potential, a holistic education that equips them with skill sets to make a full contribution to the development of Ghana and themselves. An education that looks beyond merely passing examinations but rather at building character, nurturing values and raising literate, confident and useful citizens that are equipped with critical thinking abilities is what the APC seeks to provide.

SECONDARY EDUCATION
* Free SHS

The APC will redefine basic education to include Senior High School (SHS) and make it available for free on a universal basis to all Ghanaian youth by 2019. The Senior High School system will be organized both as a terminal education for entry into the world of work, or a preparatory stage for entry into tertiary education or technical, vocational, or agricultural training.

* Vocation and Skill Training

Vocation and Skill training will be further developed under the APC by the building of two state-of-the-art institutions and the upgrading and revamping of existing technical and vocational institutions to ensure that our workforce has world-class employable skills.

TEACHERS

* We will pay serious attention to their professional development and work environment, restoring teacher's allowances, ensuring prompt payment of salaries and promoting teachers without undue delay. We will also focus on the provision of incentives that will not only motivate teachers, but reward their hard work in the classroom.

* We will collaborate with GNAT and NAGRAT and other teaching associations to facilitate an affordable housing scheme for teachers.

* We will ensure that teachers who upgrade their qualifications are promoted promptly and that their salary increases take immediate effect.

* The APC will ensure proper decentralization of teachers' recruitment and other document processing and relieve them of the frustrating,
bureaucratic processing of documents at the centre.

PRIMARY EDUCATION

We will reintroduce the History of Ghana as a subject for primary schools. To ensure that standards are improved and maintained across pre-tertiary education, the APC government will strengthen and equip the Inspectorate Division in order for it to carry out its mandate of inspecting and regulating the provision of good quality education whilst providing good value for
money in education.

SCIENCE AND MATHS EDUCATION

We will aggressively promote Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education across all levels of the education system. An APC government will leverage technology to popularize the teaching and learning of Mathematics. Children in every part of the country will have access to mathematics lessons delivered at the highest level. We aim to demystify mathematics and turn Ghana into a mathematics-friendly nation.

MISSION SCHOOLS

We will strengthen the participation of the Missions in the Mission-founded schools. We believe this will ensure the return of discipline and moral upbringing to our schools.

ARABIC EDUCATION

We will support Arabic/Islamic instructors with training and other incentives to motivate them to provide good training for our children. We will introduce Arabic as an optional language to be taught and examined at the JHS and SHS levels.

COUNSELING AND GUIDANCE

There will be an intense focus on providing effective and professional guidance and counselling services to pupils, students and young people to facilitate their personal growth and development.

SPORTS

The APC will provide sporting facilities and revive sporting competitions among schools not only for health purposes, but also as a career pathway for students, while fostering a spirit of competitiveness and teamwork.

INCLUSIVE EDUCATION

In terms of inclusive education, the APC will establish structures that ensure weaker children (and those with special needs) are not left behind, but rather are developed by a crop of teachers with the requisite skills in differentiated teaching methods.

ICT AND EDUCATION

The APC shall improve the facilities and curriculum for ICT education at all levels. We shall develop an online educational platform to host, stream, and share short videos of mini-lectures to classrooms or offices around the country. We shall ensure that all teachers have ICT competence.

The APC will introduce programming at the Junior and Senior High Levels in order to expand the capacity of our students in ICT and train them for the job opportunities that the sector offers.

TERTIARY EDUCATION

1. We will ensure that Colleges of Education have updated and relevant curricular to ensure graduates from these institutions are of similar quality to their peers trained anywhere in the world.

2. Teacher trainee allowances will be fully restored.

3. We will ensure the realignment of Polytechnics as Technical Universities to their original mandate of providing high level technical and vocational training to the Ghanaian workforce.

4. In addition to the Book and Research allowances for lecturers, the APC will establish a Research Fund to further facilitate research and innovation.

5. We will place an emphasis on the continuous linkage with industry and the world of work to ensure programme relevance, develop employable skills, and thereby reducing graduate unemployment.

EDUCATION CURRICULA

We will restructure the education curricula to teach and equip Ghanaians students with the relevant skill sets to meet the needs of industry and future opportunities.

We will reorient the educational curriculum at all levels, especially higher education, to impart the knowledge and attitudes needed to promote self-employment and entrepreneurship rather than salaried employment.

CHAPTER 2.
HEALTH
APC 2017 ­ 2020 Priority Areas

The Health System in Ghana is a pivotal one for national development. The APC deeply recognizes that a wealthy nation is a healthy nation. In today's global village, global health concerns are national security issues.

Our APC manifesto seeks to position Ghana in a direction to comprehensively address local, national and emerging global earth concerns e.g. Zika and Ebola viruses and the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.

The APC broadly classifies our challenges into three priority areas.

* Global Health Concerns

* National Health Emergencies

* National Health concerns

To ensure that Ghana is a healthy nation, the APC will:

1. Rescue and Restructure the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)

The NHIS has not been run well by both the NPP and the NDC. The APC government will revive the National Health Insurance Scheme to make it efficient, with capacity to finance health services on a timely basis in a bid to achieve universal health coverage for all Ghanaians by:

* Directing and strictly ceding all funds raised through the NHIA Levy into the healthcare sector, and to the activities that focus on quality patient treatment, medication, and care.

* Utilizing the best in technology and health insurance management protocols to tackle waste, corruption, and insurance claim fraud under
the NHIS.

15. Developing an inter-sectorial action plan to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy and early marriage.

16. Improving health data quality to inform local, district and national planning.

CHAPTER 3.
SECURITY

The APC believes that the simple blanket implementation of our existing laws by our security agencies, without selectivity, will go a long way to sanitize our society, assuage the fears of the citizenry and dramatically transform our society.

In this regard, the APC government will ensure that all our security personnel are properly-trained, properly-resourced, and provided with incentives to enable them professionally discharge their duties and obligations fairly and effectively without ANY interference from the executive branch of government.

THE POLICE SERVICE

The APC in government will resource our police to continue to maintain law and order and protect lives and property. Our policies are outlined below.

We will:

* Review and restructure recruitment into our Police Service to stamp out the fraud and cronyism that has bedeviled recent recruitments;

* Continue to recruit additional personnel into the Police Service, as we work towards the target of meeting the UN ration of 1:500 police to civilians;

* Ensure that our marine police unit is expanded and resourced;

* Provide the police with modern communication and policing equipment;

a. Pre-trial detention

b. Prison Management

c. Alternative measures and sanctions

d. Social integration

e. Health facilities

NARCOTICS AND ILLICIT DRUG TRADE

We will introduce a robust and comprehensive anti-narcotic drug and anti-organized crime policy with severe sanctions and penalties to serve as deterrence for potential offenders. Our policy will seek to educate the youth about the hazards of narcotic drugs and organized crime.

Working with our international partners, we will institute measures to prevent hard drugs from being imported into Ghana and also get rid of Ghana's reputation as a trans-shipment pint.

We will strengthen our detection institutions and systems. 

SMALL ARMS

We will put measures to curb the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, and enforce laws on its illegal possession, manufacturing and trade.

CHAPTER 4.

YOUTH AND SPORTS
YOUTH AGENDA

The APC believes that the youth are the drivers of innovation and growth and our national youth policy objectives will set a new vision for leadership development and the development of sports. We will create an enabling environment to build the capacity of our youth to take on more active roles in our country's future and its development.

In pursuant to this, a Hassan Ayariga government will focus on the following:

* Set up a Youth Development Authority (YDA) to coordinate and harmonise all government ­ sponsored youth initiatives.

* Establish a Youth Enterprise Fund.

* Develop industrial parks in all regions targeting young Ghanaians who start small businesses to provide them with access to a clean workspaces, equipment, funding and basic amenities like electricity and water.

* Introduce a policy where at least 5% of all Government procurement is contracted from entities established under the Youth Enterprise Fund or entities established by persons under 35.

* Offer tax incentives to young entrepreneurs to encourage them to initiate start-up businesses.

* Introduce tax credits and other incentives for Companies that hire young people.

* Focus on ICT training to create job avenues locally and offshore for our youth.

* Institute a Buy-Local policy for Government agencies with regards to ICT to ensure that applications and software are procured from indigenous ICT firms.

SPORTS DEVELOPMENT

Many years of low investments in sports development has resulted in low morale and poor achievements. The absence of an adequate legal framework for sports development and promotion, also hinders the development of sports. The lack of maintenance culture has led to the deterioration of sports infrastructure, and the neglect of school sports and other sporting disciplines have resulted in the fallen standards.

An APC administration will also create an enabling environment that will provide the right incentive for Public Private Partnership (PPP) in Sports. Under the APC, sports development and promotion will be prioritized.

We will pursue the following:

1. Modernize sports through the provision of the right legal framework by passing into law the comprehensive Sports Bill initiated under
President Kufuor.

2. Ensure that District Assemblies fully participate in sports development and promotion.

3. The Ministry will collaborate with Local Assemblies to rehabilitate dilapidated football parks across the country to help develop lower league football.

4. Promote the construction of sports facilities within communities in partnership with the private sector.

5. Develop Youth Development and Sports Centres in all Regions. Each centre will house a fully equipped library, ICT hub, social hall, multi-purpose pitches and courts.

6. Pursue the vision of providing modern multi-sport stadia for the Regions without one ­ Brong Ahafo, Eastern, Upper East, Upper West and Volta;

7. Establish a special unit at the Ministry to develop and promote other sporting disciplines and inter schools sports;

8. Put in place an effective maintenance regime in partnership with the Private Sector.

9. Create a Sports Fund.

10. Encourage the private sector to provide funding for sports through the establishment of incentive packages.

11. Award scholarships to promising young athletes so they can development in the best of environments.

CHAPTER 5.
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Building a Compassionate Society
We aim to create a society of fair opportunities for all Ghanaians. The APC government will create a compassionate society which ensures that all citizens share in Ghana's wealth and prosperity. This will be achieved by establishing a well-funded, functioning welfare system to address the needs of the weak, marginalized, vulnerable and socially excluded.

We will:

* Amend the Disability Act.

* Pass appropriate Legislative Instruments for the Mental Health Act.

* Staff and properly resource the National Council on Persons with Disability.

* Implement inclusive education and equal employment opportunity policies.

* Ensure the National Disability Council is decentralized to the regional level in order to coordinate the activities of the various federations.

* Establish a special scholarship package for people with disabilities from the basic to the tertiary level.

* Set up a special training school for persons with disability, with campuses in the northern and the southern sectors, to train them on
technical and skill training programmes.

* Encourage both public and private institutions to reserve a quota of jobs that can be filled by persons with disability.

Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP):

* Adopt effective means-testing to properly target, identify, and enroll beneficiary households. Establish a consistent and regular monthly disbursement plan.

* Target female-headed households where intervention may have the greatest positive impact.

The Ghana School Feeding Programme:

* Adequately fund, rationalize, and improve monitoring processes under the Ghana School Feeding Programme.

* Train caterers on the hygienic preparation of nutritious food.

* Provide adequate funding for monitoring.

* Ensure regular payments are made to caterers.

* Motivate caterers and link them directly to local farmers to promote use of local foodstuffs.

Mainstream aging, retirement, and pensions into national planning and service delivery

We will develop and implement policies for the aged and mainstream aging issues into national development frameworks and poverty education strategies. We aim to address, develop and improve the coverage ofa comprehensive social protection systems for senior citizens.

To this end, the APC will:

* Fully implement the provisions under the National Pensions Act (2008), Act 766.

* Use the appropriate information technology platform to decentralize and automate pension payments, and establish desks in each District Assembly for this purpose.

* Establish a pension scheme for farmers, ancillary workers and members of small scale business associations like drivers of the
GPRTU.

Social Security and Employee Benefits

APC shall put an elaborate social security system that sees to it that;

Ghanaian citizens live comfortably even if they're sick, disabled, unemployed or retired.

* People with jobs must, as a rule, make payments to four parts of the system, for health insurance, long-range nursing care, pensions and unemployment. These payments shall constitute about 40% of gross income, but the employer will pay half of the cost, meaning that the employee is paying only 20% of his income. Other pillars of the social security program are company accident insurance, paid for completely by the employer, and social indemnity, which the state handles.

* The premiums will depend on income. The greater it is the more you get paid, up to a certain limit. The premium is about 14.6% of gross income for the national health insurance, the exact amount depending on the insuring company. Premiums are paid on income per year. For long-range nursing care insurance the payment will be 2.35% ­ 2.60% on monthly income.The yearly income limits for pension and unemployment insurance charges are 18.7% for pension insurance and 3% for unemployment insurance.

Employed persons making more money have the option of either remaining in the statutory health insurance plan or taking out private insurance. The employer still will, with certain limitations, pay close to half the premiums of the private insurance plan. Self-employed persons can, under certain circumstances, also be insured under the statutory plan, or they may take out private insurance regardless of their income.

* Persons in both the statutory and private health plans are automatically enrolled in the long-range nursing insurance plan, covering health costs resulting from old age or disability.

* Pension insurance
This statutory old age insurance fund will ensure that employees can maintain an appropriate standard of living when they retire. Payments are generally made from age 65, and the maximum payout currently amounts to some 67% of average net income during the insured's working life. (The retirement age is to be gradually increased to 67 over the next 20 years.) It is not unusual for persons to receive retirement payments from two or more countries.

Unemployment insurance

This will be received by persons who have paid their premiums for at least one year during the previous five years. They must register with the Labor Office and be available to its placement service, agreeing to accept a job found for them if it is consistent with their training and experience. And they must check regularly with the Labor Office. If they do this they will receive a percentage of their most recent net income. The exact payment depends on the individual's circumstances.

* These payments will continue for six months to two years, depending on your age and length of employment. After that state assistance kicks in. The unemployed person gets a monthly sum plus allowances for housing and certain other things. But they only get this money if they need it. They may get less, or none at all, if they have independent means or if their spouse works.

Accident insurance

* The statutory accident insurance system will offer protection and assistance in the event of mishaps at work, or on the way to and from work. And it provides the same for your children at school or on the way to or from school. It also covers any job-incurred illnesses.

Payments will cover the costs of treatment and recuperation, pensions in the event of invalidity and funeral costs in the event of death. The employer pays the premiums on this one in their entirety.

Social indemnity

This will be for persons whose adverse condition is considered the responsibility of the community, and is paid by the state. Those covered include disabled war veterans, war widows and orphans, soldiers with service-incurred health problems and the victims of violent crime.

Unemployment benefits

* APC government will give unemployment benefit to Ghanaians who are not legally employed and food benefit to support their livelihood.

* To receive unemployment benefits, you must inform the labour office that you are unemployed and apply for the benefit.

* You are required to report voluntarily any change in your personal situation to the labour office, in case the change may impact your
entitlement to benefits (e.g. if you start to receive a pension or have found a job).

* Unemployed persons with children receive 67% of net wage without children, 60% of the net wage

Children Allowance

* APC government shall give child allowance to all Ghanaian children whose parents are unemployed in Ghana under our benefit policy.
Ghanaian children will be entitled to child allowance from birth to working age or when one is gainfully employed.

Maternity Allowance

* APC government will give maternity allowance to pregnant women. The policy is designed to assist would-be mothers to prepare towards their maternal journey, they will also receive free counseling through that policy

* Food benefit Based on our plan to undertake mechanized farming to guarantee food Security. Through our policy for mechanized farming and attitude towards marking our country a production base. We shall attain food security, and will give food benefit to our unemployed men and women of our nation. We shall coordinate it through our date base system to make sure distribution and collection is done properly.

Women Empowerment and Children's Rights

The APC remains committed to gender equality and children's rights and will work assiduously to ensure:

* The economic empowerment of women will be vigorously pursued through specific interventions related to predominantly female economic activity in each Region.

* A percentage of MASLOC funds are set aside for female applicants.

* We will reintroduce and enforce the administrative directive on the reservation of 30% of poverty alleviation/credit funds of MMDA's to service women's enterprises and establish strong linkages with the Rural Enterprise Project.

* The Kayayei phenomenon is curbed:

a. By improving the economy of their districts of origin to curb their migration to the south.

b. By providing alternate life skills training and seed capital

c. By building hostels to accommodate those already in the trade, with attached day care centres for their children.

d. By improving their access to health care.

* The Domestic Violence, Human Trafficking, Disability Acts and other relevant pieces of legislation implemented fully.

* The APC government will continue implementing the policies that increased enrolment and retention in schools like the school feeding
and capitation grant. Special emphasis will also be placed on proper diagnosis and treatment of children with learning disabilities like
dyslexia and other special needs. Their education will be mainstreamed as far as practicable with the full implementation of the
inclusive education policy.

* We will introduce a District Integrated Social Services programme for children, families and vulnerable adults to consolidate the health, education, justice (DOVVSU) and all social protection programmes.

* The APC will establish a Child Protection System to identify and tackle the underlying factors including the family and poverty related issues that create children in need, children at risk of harm and children suffering harm.

* We will strengthen and enforce regulations and introduce national minimum standards for residential children's homes.

* The APC government will reform the adoption and foster care regime and provide incentives for fostering 'at-risk' children.

* Women with disability

Women with disabilities constitute 42.46 percent of the total disabled population.They require protection against exploitation and abuse.
Special programmes will be developed for education, employment and provision of other rehabilitation services to women with
disabilities bearing in mind their special needs.
Programmes will be undertaken to rehabilitate abandoned disabled women/girls by encouraging their adoption into families, support to
house them and training for gainful employment skills.
Steps shall be taken to provide short duration stay homes for women with disabilities, hostels for working disabled women, and homes for aged disabled women.The APC Government will implement a programme to provide financial support to women with disabilities so that they may hire services to look after their children.

CHAPTER 6.
INFRASTRUCTURE

The APC will embark on a sustainable and integrated infrastructural development programme across the country, including a modern road network, housing, water systems, aviation, ICT, and railways. We will ensure the best value for money and meaningful Ghanaian participation in ICT at all levels. We shall create jobs and prosperity through our Integrated Infrastructure Development Programme.

National Asset Protection Project

One of the major challenges in the efficient management of public finances, and in economic development is the inability or unwillingness of succeeding governments to complete projects started by their predecessor governments. Currently, billions of Ghana Cedis are locked up in numerous uncompleted projects scattered across the country.

Our government will establish a National Asset Protection Project to perform the following functions:

* Conduct a physical and financial audit to locate, identify and value each of these assets.

* Conduct a Social Impact, Economic Impact, & Financial Viability Assessment of each of these assets with the view of completing those that meet a set criteria.

* Establish an Asset Securitization Bank as a vehicle to raise funds for completion of these projects.

Aside such a policy leading to the protection of national assets and safeguarding national wealth, it will lead to three major benefits:

* Job Creation: An army of student architects and draughtsmen, as well as property valuers and related professionals will be deployed in
all districts to conduct the audit.

* Value Creation: The Government will be able to tap into a vast pool of funds for completion of these projects and further development.

* Continuity of Projects: It will ensure that there is a continuity in development as funds available to continue projects started by
predecessor governments without a break. We intend to continue and complete projects started by the NDC administration and bring closure to the disgraceful spectacle of abandoned projects around our country.

Roads and Railways

Transportation infrastructure is one of the weakest sectors in our development and until we solve the deficit in the roads and railways, we
shall remain underdeveloped. One of our major financing strategies for infrastructure development will be to embark on Public-Private-Partnerships, where appropriate.

The APC policy on road and transport seeks to achieve the following:

* Reduce cost of building roads: - Streamline the awarding of contracts and strengthen the procurement process to maximize value for money.

* Increase the quality of life of our citizens by reducing traffic and congestion, reducing the negative effect of dust pollution on their
health, reducing travel time to the hospital, and reducing road traffic accidents.

The APC will achieve these objectives by:

* Road and Transportation Cost Reduction Strategies

We will strictly adhere to the provisions of the procurement law in order to reduce high project costs. We will pass legislation to the effect that at least 20% of the implementation of road contracts awarded to foreign contractors should be sub-contracted to local contractors.

Integrate data of the DVLA, police and insurance companies in order to reduce time and cost of acquiring necessary documents and permits needed to register vehicles.

Continue the expansion of the ports and fully automate the process for clearing goods and vehicles.

* Enhanced movement of goods and citizens

Develop an integrated Light Rail Transit System for our major cities to connect main business districts with outlying residential locations.
Speedily complete the construction of the Western and Eastern corridor road networks.

Tar gravel roads in areas of high agricultural production and tourism.

Tar roads in District capitals and extend them to major towns within the district.

Construct the Eastern line railway from Accra to Paga through Kumasi to facilitate haulage of goods from the Eastern Region and the exploitation of iron ore and other mineral reserves in the North. This will also facilitate the operation of the Boankra Inland Port which has been rendered inoperable as a result of the absence of the Eastern Rail Line.

We shall build tram rail system to transport our people from one locality to another, A tram is a rail vehicle which runs on tracks along public urban streets, and also sometimes on a segregated right of way. We shall construct tramways in every city in Ghana. The Trams will be powered by electricity. The Trams shall run between cities and towns (inter-urbans, tram-train), and/or partially grade-separated even in the cities (light rail). Tram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than conventional trains and rapid transit trains, are often indistinct. We shall establish two different type of trams, the underground and the street trams. We will operate on dual power systems -- electricity in city streets, and diesel in more rural environments.

[Picture: Modern tram in action (Greece)]

Develop the Volta into a major transportation artery by building ferry ports at such locations as Buipe, Yapei, Yei, Makango, Kwadwokurom, Kete-Krachi, Adowso, Ekyeamanfrom, Akateng, and Boso.

* Maintenance Scheme

Clear the huge backlog of road maintenance works resulting from low performance and neglect by the NDC­led government.

Ensure thereafter a timely maintenance of roads.

The APC will establish a timely and effective preventive maintenance plan for all Metro buses.

Strengthen the current axle load control on our road corridors to reduce the deterioration rate of our roads.

* Increased Quality of Life

Tar roads leading to district and reginal hospitals in order to speed up access to health facilities in case of emergency. Establish trauma centres within hospitals along the main highways in order to facilitate medical treatment of citizens in case of an accident.

Promote research into available road construction materials to strengthen existing gravel pavements and dampen dust pollution.

Reduce fatalities and injuries on our roads by:

* Scaling up efforts in road safety programmes.

* Embarking on nationwide road sign and road marking placement.

* Reviewing location and lay-bys of fuel stations in order to reduce accidents on our highways.

Reduce traffic congestions by:

* Widening major arterial roads to dual carriage.

* Constructing lay-bys and dedicated traffic lanes for commercial vehicles

* Constructing by-passes and interchanges at major intersections like The Tema Motorway Roundabout, the Suame and Oforikrom Roundabouts in Kumasi, and the Takoradi PTC Roundabout.

Aviation

The APC seeks to make Ghana's airports the aviation hub for all international, regional, domestic airlines within West Africa.
The domestic aviation industry is under severe stress. Air fares have gone up significantly following the introduction of 17.5% VAT in 2015, coupled with a new policy to force domestic airlines to purchase handling services at the Kotoka International Airport from either Menzes or Aviance. The high cost of aviation fuel (the highest in the sub-region) and the depreciation of the Cedi have also contributed to the decline in the sector.

Consequently, passenger numbers dropped from 718,725 in 2014 to 525,440 in 2015, a 36.8% fall. Since 2011, three out of five domestic airlines have since ceased operations ­ Citylink, Fly540 and Antrak. Even the domestic airlines in operation now are doing so under severe constraints.

To address these challenges, the APC will:

* Reduce the price of aviation fuel to match prices in the sub-region.

* Review the current baggage handling arrangements for domestic airlines

* Review the 17.5% VAT that was imposed on domestic air transportation.

* Encourage and support Ghanaian airlines and entrepreneurs to set up strong private airlines that can fully utilize all the route rights for
the benefit of the economy.

Water Infrastructure

WATER FOR ALL

We will seek to integrate the management of water resources into the economic development activity in order to raise revenue and properly
control its usage.

Under the APC's Water for all agenda, our goal is to ensure that every Ghanaian has access to potable water.

The APC will achieve this by:

* Sinking at least 25,000 new boreholes and an additional 300 small town water supply systems in the rural areas and small towns.

* Undertaking major water systems (treatment plants and associated distribution systems)

* Ensuring that the water sector gets the investment that it needs to upgrade antiquated urban and rural water systems.

* Commissioning water projects to ensure constant supply of water to all district, regional, and teaching hospitals as well as educational institutions.

* Constructing storm drains to deal with the perennial flooding in Accra.

* Regulating small scale mining to protect our water bodies.

* Managing refuse collection and disposal in such a way to reduce pollution of our water bodies.

Information Communication and Technology

The APC will put ICT and data revolution at the centre of our national developmental agenda in order to make Ghana a regional ICT Hub.

We shall achieve this by engaging in the following initiatives:

* National Identification scheme: We shall endeavour to register every resident of Ghana within the first two years of taking office.

* Mainstream ICT in public sector:

- Establish an integrated Data Warehouse of databases from key public institutions using the National Identification Card as the unique identifier for users.

- Automate the processes involved in accessing public services at both national and local government offices.

* Improving telecommunications accessibility:
We will facilitate nationwide access to mobile networks.

* Create opportunities for entrepreneurship
We shall develop ICT Incubator Hubs in various regional capitals to create business opportunities in the private sector.

* Increase citizens' accessibility to the data platform by reducing tariffs on the use of data for internet access.

* Work with the private sector to increase the broadband bandwidth and speed of connections nationwide.

HOUSING

Quality, Affordable Housing for All

Our vision is to use an appropriate mix of public policy and public-private investments to deliver quality, affordable social housing and private housing solutions that meets the needs and financial capacity of the average Ghanaian. We recognize the dream of every Ghanaian to own a home. We also recognise that for majority of Ghanaians, ownership may not be the route towards a decent accommodation, unlike renting. Our thinking and approach to solving these twin aspirations is to adopt a novel way to the construction of homes, and instituting creative financing schemes.

There are three main constraints to housing Ghanaians:

* A deficit which has created a backlog

* Undersupply of annual requirements of housing units
* High cost of buying and/or renting a home

The solution to these constraints would be to undertake high quality social, low and mid-income housing delivery within the short, medium and long term.

To develop the housing sector, the government of the APC will:

* improve overall affordability and access to decent homes for all working Ghanaians and their families in modern communities.

* Develop housing units targeted at the vulnerable and the marginalized in society.

* Develop financing schemes to assist home buyers to acquires.

* Improve the quality of infrastructure in existing communities.
 
* Use public policy to develop the entire housing value-chain.

We will:

* Establish land banks with infrastructure such as roads, drainage, water and power in place for the development of affordable housing units on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.

* Offer tax incentives to local real estate developers.

* Work with the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT), and Farmers' Groups to facilitate the construction of homes for their members through the provision of the appropriate financing guarantees.

* Create a Home Ownership Mortgage Enterprise (HOME) that will leverage the provisions under the National Pensions Act, Act 766 to underwrite, and where possible, affordable mortgage facilities for home buyers. This will also be used to push the acceleration of the Tier 3 component of the new pensions regime to get more informal workers to invest in their pensions into acquiring a home.

* We will implement a national policy requiring every public building including new homes built under all PPP arrangements to install solar
panels and water-harvesting technologies.

CHAPTER 7.

NATURAL RESOURCES ­ LAND, FORESTRY AND MINING

Introduction

Ghana's natural resources, upon which so much of the country's economic activity and the population's livelihood depend are being depleted at an alarming rate. More than 50% of the original forest area has been converted to agricultural land by clearing for perennial or annual cropping.

The APC policy on forestry resources will seek to rehabilitate degraded forest reserve areas trough planting of fast-growing indigenous and exotic species, conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.

Restoration of degraded areas and plantation establishment

The APC will target annually 30,000 hectare (ha) of degraded areas within and outside forest reserves for restoration and plantation development using fast growing indigenous and exotic species. We will develop and support small scale community tree nurseries

* Community nurseries for trees will be established in a minimum of 800 communities ­ averagely 4 communities per district.

Bamboo and Rattan plantations development

Currently, rattan is extensively used in the furniture and handicraft industry while bamboo is mainly used for construction. It is projected that 50,000 hectares of these plantations would be required to augment the supplies from natural stands over the next 25 years. The APC will support the annual establishment of 1,000 hectares of bamboo and rattan plantation and will encourage individuals and private sector involvement through the provision of subsidized planting material.

Support conservation of biodiversity and priority ecosystems

* Continue the opening of forestry boundaries,

* Re-survey and demarcate forests with permanent concrete pillars,

* Support the protection of the remaining network of natural forest and biodiversity hotspots in the country to serve as gene banks for
indigenous species and refuge areas for threatened, endemic and rare species.

Launch an Apiculture Forest Conservation Programme

Two million bee-hives will be made available to forest fringe communities, in the next four years, as a forest protection mechanism and job creation incentive.

Ecotourism

The APC will support the enhancement of the ecotourism industry in Ghana to further boost its potential and contribution to economic
development.

Promote sustainable water resource management

Water is a dwindling resource and the threat of water scarcity looms large. Trends indicate that Ghana would be a 'water stressed' state by 2025, and the gap between the demand and supply would be 50%.

We will address this threat in a comprehensive manner:

Protection of water catchment areas

We will launch the Clean Rivers Programme across the country with the participation of voluntary organisations. The goal of this programme is to maintain and improve the quality of water resources, within each river basin through an ongoing partnership with water stakeholders, local government, businesses and citizens.

The APC will promote:

* Replanting of trees along the banks of all major water bodies and their tributaries to reduce silting and other negative human activities near river banks.

* Dry season gardening within the buffer zone to protect river banks. Construct canals and/or use water pumping equipment to transport water to the farms to ensure efficient water use.

* Procure and supply farmers with high quality seeds.

* Promote improved crop rotation and integrated nutrient and pest management.

* Regular assessments of effluents into our river bodies with the view to controlling pollution

MINERAL RESOURCES

A government led by Hassan Ayariga will be environmentally conscious in granting mining leases in order to ensure protection of our environment and its biodiversity.

* To ensure that mineral revenues are efficiently managed for the benefit of Ghanaians, the APC will pass a consolidated Mineral Revenue Management Law similar to the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2011 (Act 815) to guide the use of mineral revenues in strategic sectors of our economy.

* We will mainstream critical strategic mineral feedstock into the domestic economy including low value minerals to support economic
value addition.

* We will support local mining capability by introducing institutional arrangements that promote coherence between mining policies and
Science Technology and Innovation (STI) programmes.

* We will encourage the development of shared infrastructure to integrate mining with community development.

* We will promote mining value-addition through the processing of minerals.

* We will restructure the artisanal mining subsector with a view to regularizing 'galamsey'.

* We will ensure a positive socio-economic impact of mining on local communities through appropriate interventions for community development.

* We will increase transparency in the allocation of mineral rights and the utilization of mineral revenues at national and community levels.

* We will ensure that mining and logging activities are undertaken in an environmentally sustainable manner.

* We will ensure that land restoration is undertaken after mining operations come to an end.

* We will fully decentralize the Minerals Commission by establishing additional district offices of the Commission.

CHAPTER 8.

SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION AND ENVIRONMENT

For Ghana to make strides in its development, science, technology and innovation must be essential elements in all aspects of the national
development process. The APC is committed to promoting and leveraging the efforts of the
scientific community to help transform the economy into a production based one.

To realize this, the APC will undertake the initiatives listed under each of the broad sectors of science and technology:

Governance

* We shall create the portfolio of Chief Scientific Advisor to the President to advise the President on policies regarding science
technology and innovation.

Stimulate Demand of Science and Technology

* Establish a merit-based research system to encourage scientific research for critical sectors of the economy.

* Strengthen collaboration between industry, universities, and research centres to promote the commercialization of scientific research
outputs;

* Stimulate the demand of science and technology from the private sector.

* Expand the Research and Development capabilities of the country through the establishment of regional Technology Parks.

* Establish a flagship system of Ghana Centres of Excellence (GCEs) across the country that networks all High Education Institutes, including all other research organizations such as CSIR and CRIG.

The GCEs will cover themes such as:

* Biomedical engineering
 
* Pharmaceutical technology and Bioequivalence Research

* Crop improvements and seed technology

* Environment and sanitation engineering

* Energy engineering

* Manufacturing equipment engineering

* Agricultural technology,

* Food process engineering,

* Building technology,

* Electronics and Electronic Assembly.

Furthermore we would mandate all GCEs to create multidisciplinary graduate schools to drive youth training and to conduct their core activities while maintaining permanent staff strength that is lean and effective. At least 3 GCEs would be established by the end of 2020.

Education

* Support the national policy of achieving 60:40 student ratio for the Sciences as compared to the Humanities by expanding STEM scholarship schemes.

* We shall also provide incentives and support for accredited private tertiary institutions to establish schools and faculties of science and
technology.

Energy

* Explore the use of various renewable energy alternatives, e.g. Solar, Wind, Tidal Waves and Biomass including Biogas, Wood Gasification
and Biodiesel.

Waste Management

* Use Science & Technology to identify the most economic and efficient ways to recycle urban waste.

* Build power plants that will use combustible domestic and industrial waste to generate electricity.

Agriculture and Land-use

* Use Science and Technology to map out the soil structure and composition of the country. With this data, the country can increase agricultural production by using the right mix of seeds and fertilizer at the right location.

* Work with the scientific community to identify optimal use of agrochemicals in order to reverse/reduce their effects on land, water bodies, food, and health of our citizens.

* Continue research and development to enhance land-use systems, including water management techniques, sustainable forestry techniques and improved sanitation systems.

Water

* We will facilitate research and development in technologies for water desalination.

Environment

* The APC will update and strengthen the many policies and programmes set up to manage the environment, especially the National Environmental Protection Program (NEPP) and the Environmental Action Plan (EAP).

* The APC will work with its international partners to access, in a more effective manner, the $30 billion global fund available for climate
change purposes.

CHAPTER 9.

TOURISM, CULTURE AND CREATIVE ARTS

The next APC government will focus on transforming Ghana's tourism sector through investment, innovation, the pursuit of service excellence and meaningful partnerships to enable it become a major revenue generating sector that provides a safe, memorable and enjoyable experience for tourists.

We will aggressively develop our tourist sites to bring them to world-class standards complete with the requisite amenities and facilities. To make communities take ownership and be interested in the sustainability of tourist attractions in their localities, we will champion a revenue-sharing program to inject 5% of tourism revenues from fees of well-developed tourist attractions into local community projects.

To project the image of Ghana as a globally-recognized tourism brand and market it as a preferred, exotic and safe destination of choice, we will transform the Ghana Tourism Authority into a modern, efficient research and marketing institution with the necessary technical resources and funds. We will provide the needed incentives to private sector investors to invest in new tourism facilities and upgrade existing ones. Priority will be given to high-impact facilities that have the potential to draw more patrons and increase traffic to tourist venues. These include beach resorts, quality hotels, safaris, heritage villages and fun parks.

We will make domestic tourism an aggressive plank of our tourism strategy with a marketing drive centred on entrenching a tourism culture among Ghanaians.

We will reactivate and resource the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board to function as a repository of both our cultural and historical records. We will pursue an ecotourism policy that enables us properly conserve natural tourist attractions whilst protecting the ecosystem. Government will invest in Tourism IT infrastructure such as Tourism Apps as an enabler to improve knowledge and the sharing of information about tourism opportunities in Ghana.

CULTURE

The APC government will give the Arts and Culture Industry the proper attention and incentives to flourish and to also create jobs and wealth for our people. We will give our culture pride of place in our national development.

The APC will build a detailed inventory of all our cultural assets for the nation to have a database of these assets. This inventory will include all of Ghana's tangible assets like the Larabanga mosque and intangible cultural assets like rites of passage and values and belief systems which are in danger of disappearing completely with aging traditional custodians.

The Copyright Act, Act 690, 2005, among other provisions, provides for the protection of Adinkra symbols and the older Kente designs as expression of folklore. The APC will ensure that the provisions regarding the protection of Kente and Adinkra designs are strictly enforced against illicit exploitation by foreign interests to enable Ghana maximize revenue through the proper marketing of these heirlooms.

CREATIVE ARTS

With the Creative Arts Sector being perennially under resourced, it has not blossomed enough to ensure Ghana's creative arts professionals are able to make a comfortable living off their work. The sector has the potential to greatly contribute to GDP growth. As such, the APC will focus on supporting the sector to enable it realize its full potential for generating wealth for its practitioners, create jobs and grow the
economy.

To make available funds to modernize and develop the sector, The APC will establish a Creative Arts Fund.

Nothing demoralizes a creative arts professional more than when intellectual property is stolen and misused with no consequence for the copyright thief. The APC will set up a Creative Arts Court to deal with all matters relating to the arts, complete with a dedicated enforcement unit.
To provide an effective interface with government and other key stakeholders, the APC will establish a Creative Arts Council to coordinate and harmonize the various interests and fragmented associations into a well-functioning body to protect the interests of members. We will educate the public on copyright laws and provide the necessary framework for payment of appropriate royalties for literary works. We will collaborate with the private sector interests to acquire the technology and equipment needed to log creative art works in order to determine true and deserved royalties.

In order to stimulate an interest in the arts in young people, we will promote regional and district literature, music, dance and drama competitions, particularly in schools and colleges. We will pursue the construction of modern large seating theatres in Takoradi, Tamale and Kumasi. We will also set up an additional Copyright Office in Tamale to cater for the Northern Sector in addition to the existing ones in Accra and Kumasi.

CHAPTER 10.

CHIEFTAINCY,RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS AND CIVIL SOCIETY

The APC will give due deference to Chiefs as the embodiment of the history and traditions of our people and will support the Chieftaincy institution to preserve, sustain and employ the traditional and cultural values, as well as practices that accelerate wealth creation and social harmony for total development.
Recognising the indispensable role of chiefs in local government and their existence as symbols of traditional solidarity, the APC will support our chiefs to provide the leadership and focus for local and district development. In this regard, unlike the NDC, we will ensure the regular and prompt release of Consolidated Funds disbursements due to chiefs to enable them carry out their functions.

The APC will ensure the prompt payment of royalties due Chiefs, Queen Mothers and Traditional Councils. We will provide government support to the institution of Chieftaincy in the performance of its duties, its evolution and further modernization. The APC will support the National House of Chiefs to codify and
systematize traditional laws and culture.

We will involve Chiefs, Queen mothers and Traditional Authorities in the afforestation and greening of Ghana. We will foster a collaboration of Government agencies and traditional leaders that will centre on the protection of water bodies and conservation of the environment. We will forge a new and formal collaboration between Chiefs, Queen mothers and Traditional Authorities with NADMO so that relief assistance can be better managed in our local communities during natural disasters and other emergencies.

RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS

The APC will continue to actively engage religious organizations as the leading moral-cultural institutions that have a key role in moulding the character and conduct of our citizens. We acknowledge the important role of the mission hospitals in our health care delivery system, especially the rural areas. We will therefore work with bodies such as the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) and all other stakeholders to ensure prompt payments from the NHIS fund and pay existing debts promptly.

CIVIL SOCIETY AND CHARITY ORGANISATIONS

Civil Society in Ghana plays a significant role in governance and development. Right from before independence, voluntary groups, associations and organisations have been involved in all sectors of
Ghanaian life.

The APC government will launch a new era of cooperation and collaboration with civil society to improve governance and enhance the well-being of Ghanaians. We will work to ensure that the sector develops and thrives. The APC government will review the registration requirement of civil society organisations to reflect current trends and modern realities. Through legislation, we will provide tax incentives to corporate organisations that support and partner civil society organisations to bring social and economic improvement in the lives of Ghanaians. Our government will create the enabling legislative and economic environment for philanthropy to blossom and promote a new era of giving, knowing that a prosperous Ghana makes it easier for individuals and organisations to support civil society. We will also enact a Charities Organisations law to streamline the
operations of charities in Ghana.

The APC government will focus on interventions that will unleash the potential of all, including the vulnerable, weak and excluded, particularly women, children People Living With Disability (PLWD), protect their rights
and eradicate or reform harmful, inhumane and inimical cultural and traditional practices.

CONCLUSION

We have seen many leaders emerge, showing a profound understanding of the hopes and dreams of Ghanaians, their fears and anxieties, their needs and wants. However, when they are entrusted with political authority, they become intoxicated with power and begin to behave otherwise. Soon they start making serious political blunders that bring nothing but shame and suffering to those who elected them. This evasive cycle has brought untold hardship and led to under-development of this Country.

There is a mounting sense of frustration and loss of hope each additional day that the people of our beloved country have to wait for change to come. Ghana with a diverse and rich mineral resource base still remains as one of the poorest countries in the world. It is demoralizing to note that Ghana, once the beacon of hope in Africa still remains somewhat dependent on international financial and technical assistance as well as the activities of the extensive Ghanaians in Diaspora. The domestic economy of Ghana continues to revolve around small scale agriculture, which accounts for 35 percent of GDP and employs about 60 percent of the workforce. Moreover, over half of the population has no access to clean drinking water, uninterrupted electricity, basic health services, and quality education.

Yet any pragmatic discussion of the country's economic situation degenerates into bickering partisanship, name calling, insults, heated tribalistic arguments that fail to identify the problems let alone address them. All these pointers leave one to doubt whether our past and present regimes have the capacity to produce and execute a national development plan that would lead Ghana on the road to economic advancement and progressive social change. Past and present regimes have made numerous lofty claims about
economic growth, but the growth has been 'snail paced' and public expenditure for social development has decreased.

Despite the promises, employment generation in the formal sector has been completely stagnant. Since major quantitative restrictions have been lifted as at 1992, Ghanaian market has been flooded with cheap foreign goods, which are affecting indigenous small-scale manufacturing sector adversely.

After years of liberalization, we need to raise critical questions about the increasing gap between the goal of macroeconomic development and social development. Why is the growing economy of Ghana so slow in reaching out to impoverished millions in remote villages, suburban and congested urban slums?

It is for these reasons that the All People's Congress (APC) respectfully seeks Ghanaians' mandate to positively transform Ghana beginning from 7th January 2017-7th January 2021.

The All People's Congress (APC) under Dr. Hassan Ayariga's Presidency is the only Party that can positively transform the socio-economic conditions of Ghana and bring total prosperity to all Ghanaians through an All-inclusive governance approach when elected into power in 7th December 2016 general election.

I respectfully urge you to support the APC by voting for Dr. Ayariga's Presidency and our Parliamentary Candidates on the 7th December, 2016.

Ladies and gentlemen, the NPP and NDC know the problems of our country, but the APC knows the solutions.

Our Agenda for 2016, promises nothing but jobs, prosperity and securing the future. This is our solemn pledge to the people of Ghana.

CHAPTER 29.
IMPACT OF CYBER SPACE ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Like other countries, Ghana is increasingly reliant on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for the progress of the nation. By exploiting the advantages created by automation, networked computers and digital communication the economy has been stimulated and growth enhanced.
Management of the national electricity grid benefits from ICT, election results are efficiently transmitted, a national database of biometric records of citizens has been developed and the banking sector utilizes ICT to improve the efficiency of payment systems.
However even as ICT opens up access and simplifies information management, criminal elements continue to probe the systems to identify weaknesses that can be exploited.
Protecting our national systems from criminal intrusion, what is called cyber security, has become the most critical national security objective in the near future.
There are significant exposure risks in the use of the internet, such as when Government officials transmit confidential information utilizing insecure or unprotected private networks. But by far the most critical need is how to secure our sensitive information and databases from cyber-attacks.
The cyber security objective is to safeguard the integrity of our ICT infrastructure by eliminating
* Hacking, which is the unauthorized entry and exploitation of the information in databases;
* Mobile phone fraud;
* Financial fraud (Sakawa) and money laundering;
* The use of our ICT assets to promote terrorist activities.

The NDC intends to implement a national cyber security policy and strategy to secure the data in Ghana's networks and help protect sensitive Government data, including information about individuals.
Governments are unable to fully regulate activities over the internet because it does not occur in the physical environment, which is easy to control in the nation-state. In Ghana, this weakness is compounded by weak and uncoordinated responses to threats to the national information infrastructure.
The pace of technology development has left many national institutions with technical capacity deficits. Law enforcement in particular is vulnerable and is under pressure to respond, but is yet to be adequately equipped with tools and technical capacity to manage the specialized cases emerging.
The next NDC administration plans to confront four critical tasks:
* Improve the awareness of the risks confronting the country;
* Create the capacity to develop and manage the structures needed to combat cyber-crime;
* Enhance international cooperation by establishing a network with key partners in the global cyber security system;
* Establish an elite national cyber security unit to coordinate cyber security operations, harness existing skills and facilities and develop an operational plan to combat the threats that will be identified.
CHAPTER 30.
FIGHTING NARCO-TERRORISM

We have maintained our strong stance against narcotics trafficking and have demonstrated our firm commitment to making Ghana a no-go area for drug traffickers and their hirelings. We have restored confidence in Ghana's ability to collaborate with stakeholders, nationally and internationally to relentlessly combat narcotics trafficking. This is demonstrated by the very effective anti narco-terrorism campaign waged by the NDC Government.
Consistent with our commitment, we were able to achieve the following in the last four years:

* Laid the Narcotics Control Commission Bill before Parliament to convert the Narcotics Control Board into a Commission with more effective and regulatory powers;
* Substantially increased NACOB's staff strength to enable it discharge its mandate;
* Established a NACOB surveillance centre at the Tema Fishing Harbour;
* Empowered NACOB to undertake campaigns to create awareness about the negative effects of drugs;
* Instituted significant preventive and remedial mechanisms.

OUR COMMITMENT (2017-2021)

We will

* Step up international cooperation in the fight against the narcotics trade;
* Complete the process of converting NACOB into a commission, and empower it to heighten vigilance and intensify the campaign of creating awareness about the disastrous effects of drug abuse;

CONCLUSION

In 2017, the National Democratic Congress will celebrate its 25th Anniversary. It will be historical and will represent a significant approval by the people of Ghana of the performance of our Government. We made a number of promises in our 2012 Manifesto and the records show that we have delivered more than we pledged in several sectors. But for the prolonged global developments that adversely affected the earnings from Ghana's export commodities and increased the prices of imports, the record of our achievements would have been even more remarkable. We demonstrated that with prudent management, the negative impact of the global challenges could be managed. Our economy is becoming more robust and resilient and this has led to several positive forecasts and a better outlook for Ghana in the future. Our investments in infrastructure and in the social services such as education, health, housing and water are providing opportunities for the private sector to create jobs. We practiced an open, accountable and responsive government, which contributed tremendously to the enjoyment of personal freedoms, the maintenance of peace and security and the protection of our territorial integrity. We are deeply committed to continuing the good work of the past four years and we are confident that the good people of Ghana will continue to repose confidence in the stewardship of John Dramani Mahama and our Parliamentary Candidates, who will help deliver on the commitments in this Manifesto. This Manifesto contains policies and programmes that will consolidate the achievements so far made and, in addition, introduce new initiatives that will launch Ghana into a new era of accelerated growth and the transformation of our society. As the goal of the 2016 Manifesto states, the implementation of our policies and programmes is to change your life and transform Ghana. The Manifesto is our compact with you, the people of Ghana, and given our record of promising and delivering, we urge you to renew our mandate with a massive vote for the NDC's Presidential and Parliamentary candidates in December 2016.

Stay with those you trust. Vote for the NDC!
